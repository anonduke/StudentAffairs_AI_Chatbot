https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/applying-to-conestoga,Will you make decisions based on first semester mid-term marks?,Yes. We will make decisions based on first-semester mid-term marks for applicants who have met academic requirements and academic strength. Any offers sent out based on mid-term marks would be conditional upon successful completion of the course and the final mark.
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/applying-to-conestoga,Will you make admissions decisions based only on grade 11 marks?,"No. Conestoga College will not generate offers based solely on grade 11 marks. If the admission requirement is a Grade 12 subject, the College must have, at a minimum, confirmation of enrolment in the required subject. Where the minimum subject requirement is Grade 12, Grade 11 marks in required subjects may be used in the calculation of academic strength for those applicants currently enrolled in the required subjects. In such cases, any offers of admission would be conditional upon the successful completion of the required Grade 12 course and the final grade in that course. In the case of oversubscribed programs, many of these programs are full after the first round of admission decisions is made. This means that admission decisions are based on the marks available in early February. This may be a combination of final grades in required courses, mid-term grades in required courses, or marks from relevant Grade 11 courses. If the program is full prior to the College receiving second semester mid-term grades, we will NOT re-calculate the academic strength based on the second semester grades. However, we will use available second semester grades to determine the position on the wait list of applicants who have received a wait list offer."
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/applying-to-conestoga,Are you making offers beginning November 1?,"Yes. Effective fall 2021, Ontario Colleges can start sending offers of admission on November 1 to applicants who have met the admissions requirements for their program. Some programs, including oversubscribed programs, will not send offers until after the equal consideration date (February 1) and all supplemental information or attendance at mandatory information sessions have been completed. Therefore, depending on the program, offers could be received as early as November 1, or after February 1. Offers are not sent until the Admissions Office receives official transcripts and is able to make an admission decision."
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/applying-to-conestoga,"With offers being sent as early as November 1, is May 1 still the confirmation date?","Yes. Applicants must confirm their acceptance by May 1, unless the offer is extended after this date."
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/applying-to-conestoga,Do you accept applications after February 1?,"Yes. Applications are accepted after February 1 in most programs. While some programs fill up quickly (oversubscribed programs), many programs remain available up to the start of classes. Applicants are always encouraged to apply early and to visit www.ontariocolleges.ca to view the program offerings and their status."
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/applying-to-conestoga,Do I really need to apply before February 1 to an oversubscribed program?,Yes. Most oversubscribed programs do not accept applications later than February 1. You are encouraged to submit your application early in order to avoid missing the deadline.
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/applying-to-conestoga,"If I get a Conditional Offer of Admission, how will I know if I really have a spot in the program?","When you receive an Offer of Admission, either conditional or unconditional, this means that the spot in the program is reserved for you.

https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/payments-invoicing,Reduced tuition for students with permanent disabilities,"Students with a permanent, persistent or prolonged, documented disability who require a reduced course load as a learning accommodation may be eligible to pay a reduced tuition fee to complete their program. Students are required to identify themselves with Accessible Learning and present documentation confirming the disability and the need for a reduced course load as an accommodation. Applications are completed with your Accessibility Advisor. Details related to eligibility are set out in the Tuition and Ancillary Fees Reporting Operating Procedure. Eligibility criteria Eligibility for reduced tuition rates will commence once the student has paid full tuition fees for the entire program. If you are on a reduced course load as an accommodation and have paid the equivalent of full tuition for the program, your course fees will be adjusted to $20 per course (plus college ancillary, course materials, and online learning fees), until you complete your program.

Only the fees paid towards successfully completed courses will be included in this calculation. This policy does not cover courses that you need to take again due to late withdrawal or unsuccessful completion.                                                                                                                                             This policy only covers one program even though you may have changed programs over the time you were registered. If you register in a different program, a new application must be submitted.                                                                                                                                             Students are required to pay all required ancillary fees for each term they are enrolled at the college. Full rules for eligibility The total tuition fees to be paid before a student is eligible to pay the reduced fee must equal the tuition fees a student completing the same program in the approved duration would pay if taking the program in the same academic years and terms, as well as delivery format (i.e. compressed). This includes any applicable annual tuition fee increases.                                                                                                                                     A Student is required to pay all applicable ancillary fees for each term in which they are enrolled at the college. Only the fees paid towards successfully completed courses will be included in this calculation.                                                                                                                                     If the student paid the part-time fees for the term in which a failure occurred, the amount of fees paid towards the course is equivalent to what the student paid. This amount should be deducted from the cumulative total of fees paid.                                                                                                                                             If the student paid full-time fees for the term in which a failure occurred, the value of the failed course should be calculated by pro-rating the full-time fees based on student contact hours per course taken in that term. This amount should be deducted from the cumulative total of fees paid.                                                                                                                                             The fees paid towards any courses/terms from which a student withdraws are not included in the cumulative total of fees paid. Students transferring with advanced standing between post-secondary institutions and/or programs must have paid the equivalent in fees as a student undertaking the same program of study in the approved program duration with the same advanced standing before being eligible for the reduced fee.                                                                                                                                     The calculation of fees to be paid in order to be eligible for the reduced fee is not calculated in relation to fees already paid. Calculating fees to be paid is to be based on the amount of fees to be paid to complete the program in the Ministry-approved duration. Students returning to a program after a period of interruption must have their standing first evaluated according to the academic policies of the college to determine their program level. Once this has been determined, they will pay the equivalent in fees as a student undertaking the program of study in the approved program duration entering at the same program level and academic term before being eligible for the reduced fee. This is the same approach to calculating eligibility as for students transferring with advanced standing.                                                                                                                                     As noted above, the calculation of fees to be paid in order to be eligible for the reduced fee is not calculated in relation to fees already paid. Calculating fees to be paid is to be based on the amount of fees to be paid to complete the program in Ministry-approved duration."

https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/payments-invoicing,Deposit fee questions,"When is the tuition deposit due? For a list of deposit due dates, refer to Student fee invoices and payment. When are student invoices posted? Invoices are posted on the Student Portal 4-6 weeks before the deposit due date. Does the initial deposit count towards tuition fees or is it in addition to my total fees? The $500 mandatory tuition fee deposit (for domestic students) is part of your tuition fees and reduces the amount you owe. How does the deposit work? Does it have to be paid each term? The Ministry of Colleges and Universities policy states that a deposit is assessed on a per program/per academic year basis. Therefore, in a normal situation (no program change) the student pays it once per year. Can I pay my deposit now? The billing of fees will take place in early June at which time fees may be paid. If I am an OSAP recipient do I have to pay the deposit? Yes, if you are receiving OSAP funding you must pay the tuition deposit by the deposit deadline. What if I am an OSAP recipient and do not have enough money for the deposit? As in the past, there will be a process for students who qualify to request an exception to the deposit amount. Additional information will be available through the Financial Services Office. I am waiting for my RESP; do I have to pay the deposit? Yes, the tuition deposit is due by the due date unless the student qualifies for special consideration under the OSAP process. If I have a co-op level for the first level of the academic year (i.e. fall) am I expected to pay a deposit? Students who have a co-op level as the first level of their program for the academic year (i.e. in the fall) will be billed for the CSI Health plan with a due date of August 2 and payment by this date is expected. The deposit due date will be in October as the first academic level is during the winter term."
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/payments-invoicing,Fees and payments,"Can I still pay the full-year tuition fees? Yes, a student may still pay the full fees as per the Student Fee Invoice but a student does not have to pay prior to the fees due date stated on the invoice(s). Do I have to pay deferral fees? No. The ministry no longer allows colleges to charge a deferral fee and as such, have required colleges to bill by term and permit payment by term. Therefore, students no longer need to request to defer to a later date as the timeframe has been established by the ministry. Can I pay my tuition and deposit in person? No, all in-person payments for program tuition and course registration will no longer be accepted. All deposit, tuition and course fee payments must be made through the Student Portal using online/web banking. Will I be able to pay my $500 deposit through the Student Portal? If so, will I be able to pay the remainder of my fees through the portal as well? Yes, fees may be paid through the Student Portal. How can I confirm that the college has received my payment? To confirm your payment has been received, log in to the Student Portal. Select the 'Financial' tab, then select 'My Fees'. Note: Payments made through the Student Portal or online banking can take three to five business days to process. Students should ensure payments are received by the due date. What happens if I don’t make a payment by the deadline? Accounts which reflect a tuition fee payment made after the due date will be assessed the late fee. A late penalty fee will not be assessed on the deposit. Tuition deposit: Returning students who do not pay the tuition deposit by the deadline will not be able to register for classes and/or view their timetable.

Requests must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar using the Fee Exceptions Request form within 30 days of the student's withdrawal date. Submissions received after this date will not be considered. 1. The student's submission must detail facts, particularly dates, circumstances and how these circumstances affected the student's ability to continue in their program. Evidence verifying these circumstances must be provided. Incomplete submissions will not be reviewed. Circumstances of financial hardship, including personal or familial, are not eligible for fee exceptions. Considerations will only be made under the following: a. Documented medical cause where the student was under direct medical care. Examples of documentation include: a letter from a doctor or certified                         medical practitioner that includes the dates where the student was under medical care and unable to continue in their studies. b. Documented personal cause. The documentation must be based on an extraordinary event and must include dates. For example, documentation could                  include a copy of an obituary and travel documents in the case of travel for a death in the immediate family. 2. The Associate Registrar, Client Services & Student Fees will convene a meeting of the committee to review submissions. a. Consultation with the appropriate departments and/or additional information may be requested from the student which may impact the timeline for                       decision making. 3. A final decision will be communicated to the student.

https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,Where can I find my T2202 form?,"Your present and past year's T2202 form(s) are available online through the Student Portal, under the Financial tab > My T2202."
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,Will the T2202 form be mailed to me?,The Registrar's Office does not mail forms to individuals as you can print your form online. Simply select the year you need and the document is available to be saved to your computer or printed.
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,Why have I not received a T2202 form?,"There are several possible reasons why you might not have received a T2202 form: Course timing: The course you enrolled in may not have started within the applicable tax year. The T2202 form is based on the calendar year, rather than the tuition payment date.                                                                                                                                             Eligible fees: You may not have paid at least $100 in eligible education fees, as this is the minimum threshold for inclusion on the T2202 form.                                                                                                                                             Study period: Your study period may not meet the required minimum length for eligibility.                                                                                                                                             Course qualification: The course you took might not qualify for a tuition tax credit. Not all courses or fees are eligible for inclusion on the T2202 form. For instance, the following types of courses are not eligible: General interest                                                                                                                                             Workshops                                                                                                                                             Assessments                                                                                                                                             Co-curricular activities                                                                                                                                             Other courses, such as Gas Technician, TSSA exams, or Canadian Red Cross Babysitting courses"
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,Why is my Social Insurance Number (SIN) required?,"As of 2020, the federal government requires a Social Insurance Number (SIN) for post-secondary institutions to issue T2202 tax forms. If the college does not have your SIN on file, you must provide it in the Student Portal to access your T2202 form(s). To add your SIN, log in to the Student Portal. Select the My Addresses tab and update your contact information. You will now be able to access your T2202 forms under the Financial tab > My T2202. If you try to access the T2202 form before providing your SIN, you will be redirected to the My Addresses tab to update your information. Once you provide your SIN, you will be able to access the T2202 tax form."
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,Do I get a T2202 form?,T2202 forms are issued to students who have paid more than $100.00 in eligible fees for qualifying post-secondary level programs/courses beginning and ending in a particular calendar year.
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,When do I receive my T2202 form?,The T2202 forms are normally available the last week of February.
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,Why does my form have months of attendance but $0.00 in tuition?,"Sponsored student's tuition is being paid by a third party and therefore will not appear on the T2202 form. Some non-semestered programs, like apprenticeship and certificate programs, will have intakes that started in the previous year. Students in these programs will have received all the tuition credit for their program on the previous year’s T2202 form but are still entitled to the months of attendance for this year's T2202."
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,Why doesn't my T2202 form match the amount I paid for?,"A student's tax receipts will reflect only the ""eligible fees"", not all the fees that may have been paid. Therefore the tax receipt will be less than the actual amount paid for a full-time program or course. Only those fees in the eligible column can be included in the tuition amount on the T2202 form.

https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,I was enrolled in both a full-time program and some part-time Continuing Education courses. Why don't I get the part-time and full-time education credits?,A student enrolled in part-time course(s) and a full-time program during the same months will only get education credit for the full-time months. A student can either claim a part-time or full-time education credit but not both for the same months. Tuition paid for the part-time course(s) and full-time program will be combined into one total amount on the T2202 form.
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,"I paid the deposit fee, but, I have withdrawn from the program. Why is the deposit fee not included in my T2202?",The deposit fee is not an eligible expense for T2202 purposes if you have withdrawn from the program.
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,I paid for my first year and my receipt reflects only half of what I paid. Where's the rest?,"Only the tuition amount and attendance credits for the taxation year can be included on the T2202 form. For example, in the current academic year, you may have paid tuition for both the fall and winter terms. However, only the fees paid and attendance credits for the fall term can be included on your current T2202 form. The tuition fees and attendance credits for the winter term will be reflected on your T2202 form for the following taxation year, which will be available next February."
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,"I'm in a co-op program but, my months of attendance don't reflect my co-op term(s).",Co-op work terms do not count towards months of attendance as you are not in school on an academic term.
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,What is the number in column B/C for?,Full-time students may claim the education credit for the months of attendance as recorded in column C and Part-time students (studying at least 12 hours per month in a course running longer than three weeks) may claim the months of attendance as recorded in column B.
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,"If I add the tuition for my Conestoga College course together with that of another institute's course, I would meet the $100.00 minimum, why won't you give me a T2202?",Students MAY NOT combine receipts from institutions to meet the minimum eligible fee as per the Income Tax Act.
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,"I received my T2202 form but, the address on it is incorrect. Do I need a new one?","You may submit the T2202 as received even if the address is incorrect. Note that it is not necessary for students to submit the T2202 form with the tax return, but they must produce it if requested by Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)."
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,Can my parents use my T2202 form?,"Students must use the Tuition & Education Credit Certificate (T2202) on their own tax return until the Federal Tax payable is reduced to zero, after which the student may then transfer the balance of the credit to another eligible party using page two of the T2202 form, as per the Income Tax Act. This requires the student's signature."
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,Who can use my unused amounts?,"You can transfer your unused current-year tuition, education, and textbook amounts to one designated individual. That individual can be either your spouse or common-law partner, your parent or grandparent, or your spouse's or common-law partner's parent or grandparent. You cannot transfer your unused current-year amounts to your parent or grandparent, or your spouse's or common-law partner's parent or grandparent, if your spouse or common-law partner claims the spouse or common-law partner amount or amounts transferred from your spouse or common-law partner on his/her tax return."
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,Can you help me with some questions about my tax return?,"Questions regarding the use of the T2202 form in the tax preparation process should be directed to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). Tax guides are available from any CRA office or a post office. CRA also publishes a booklet called P105 Students and Income Tax. In addition, you can find information specifically for students."
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/paying-your-fees/tax-receipts,"I took multiple courses as a Continuing Education student but, only one course is being shown on my tax form.","Due to space limitations, only one course is being shown on the form but the entire amount and hours are there for all courses that qualify."

Grade Point (GP) Assigned to each course, the Grade Point is a numeric representation aligned to an alpha grade and/or a percentage range. Session Grade Point Average (GPA) Represents the courses taken within a program session. The session GPA is printed on transcripts and achievement records for cohort-based programs. It is calculated by averaging the grades achieved and credit weighting by the credits assigned to each course. Program Grade Point Average (GPA) Represents all courses taken for the specified program code/version. These courses may have been taken either via the cohort or through part time studies (non-cohort). The program GPA is not related to a given session. It is based on the program code/version and all the courses the student took that are part of the program, including electives Grade Point Average - calculation The Session Grade Point Average and/or the Program Grade Point Average will be displayed on the transcript/achievement record and calculated as follows: The enrolled course must have a credit value.

For complete details about sharing your documents, please see the MyCreds Learner FAQ. 6. What are Share Credits? Instead of paying a fee per paper transcript, with the digital transcript you will purchase a specific number of ‘Share Credits’ for that document on the MyCreds Learner Portal. Each Share Credit will allow you to share the secure digital transcript with one recipient, such as an employer or an educational institution. A valid credit card is required to purchase Share Credits. For example, if you need to send transcripts to both a regulatory board and your employer, you will need to purchase two Share Credits from the MyCreds portal. In the MyCreds Learner portal, you will be able to see how many Share Credits you purchased, how many you have already used, and how many are remaining. 7. What is the cost of a digital transcript? The cost for each digital transcript Share Credit is $12 plus tax. Transcript fees are charged in Canadian dollars and can be paid by using Visa, MasterCard, Apple Pay and Google Pay. Payments are non-refundable. 8. How can I download my digital transcript as a PDF? Your digital transcript is not available for download from the Documents Page in your MyCreds Learner portal. This is one of the ways that the Office of the Registrar ensures the integrity of academic records for employers, government authorities and other verifiers. When you share the document with a third-party recipient directly through the MyCreds platform, the recipient can verify that the document is authentic and current and will have access to the transcript in PDF format which they will be able to download and retain for their record-keeping purposes. As a learner, if you need a copy of your official transcript for your own records, simply share the document with yourself by entering your own email address. This will then allow you to access and download the PDF. This option will use up one Share Credit. If you also need to share the document securely with another third party within the platform, you will need to purchase additional Share Credits.

https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/registrar-office/grading-transcripts,Statistics Canada notice,"Notification of disclosure of personal information to Statistics Canada Statistics Canada is the national statistical agency. As such, Statistics Canada carries out hundreds of surveys each year on a wide range of matters, including education. It is essential to be able to follow students across time and institutions to understand, for example, the factors affecting enrolment demand at postsecondary institutions. The increased emphasis on accountability for public investment means that it is also important to understand ‘outcomes’. In order to conduct such studies, Statistics Canada asks all colleges and universities to provide data on students and graduates. Institutions collect and provide to Statistics Canada, student identification information (student’s name, student ID number, Social Insurance Number), student contact information (address and telephone number), student demographic characteristics, enrolment information, previous education, and labour force activity. The federal Statistics Act provides the legal authority for Statistics Canada to obtain access to personal information held by educational institutions. The information may be used for statistical purposes only, and the confidentiality provisions of the Statistics Act prevent the information from being released in any way that would identify a student. Students who do not wish to have their information used can ask Statistics Canada to remove their identifying information from the national database. On request by a student, Statistics Canada will delete an individual’s contact information (name, address, or other personal identifiers) from the PSIS database.

https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/registrar-office/terms-definitions,Oversubscribed programs,"A program is considered oversubscribed when the number of qualified applicants exceeds the number of offers being sent. Most oversubscribed programs do not accept applications later than February 1 (for fall programs), July 15 (for winter programs), and November 1 (for spring programs). Many oversubscribed programs are full after the first round of admission decisions is made. This means that admission decisions are based on the marks available in early February. This may be a combination of final grades in required courses, mid-term grades in required courses, or marks from relevant grade 11 courses. If the program is full prior to the college receiving second semester mid-term grades, we will NOT re-calculate the academic strength based on the second semester grades. However, we will use available second semester grades to determine the position on the wait list of applicants who have received a wait list offer.

If your transcripts are from outside of Canada, you will need to obtain a course-by-course comprehensive evaluation. You can use an approved provider of credential evaluation services such as ICAS or WES, or you can request a credential evaluation through the college using the Assessment of International Credentials for Admissions and Credit Transfer online form. Please request this evaluation at least six weeks prior to the equal consideration date to ensure we have enough time to process your application."
https://www.conestogac.on.ca/admissions/registrar-office/terms-definitions,Mature student status,"A mature student is one who is 19 years of age or older as of the first day of classes without an Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD), or equivalent. If you possess an OSSD, regardless of your age or number of years out of high school, you will be considered on the basis of your OSSD and mature student status does not apply. If specific subject requirements are indicated, all applicants must possess those subject requirements regardless of whether they are applying as mature students; however, college, university and upgrading equivalencies may be used if applicants do not possess the appropriate subject requirements or wish to improve their grades. Mature students must demonstrate their potential to work at the post-secondary level in one of two ways: by successfully completing equivalency testing in English and/or mathematics; or                                                                                                                                             by completing a program of academic upgrading at a level appropriate to the program of choice. Applicants who have been out of high school for several years should contact our academic upgrading office to assess, review and refresh academic skills to be well-prepared for success at the post-secondary level. Participating in academic upgrading also provides applicants with the opportunity to increase their marks for competitive college programs. The college offers several ways for applicants to enhance their basic skills and improve their chances for admission on either a full-time or part-time basis. The Academic and Career Entrance certificate (ACE) is recognized as a Grade 12 equivalent for the purpose of admission at all Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology for apprenticeship training and by many major employers.
